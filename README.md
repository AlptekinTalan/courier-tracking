# Courier Tracking README

## Introduction

Welcome to the Courier Tracking application! This tool allows you to track courier locations and verify distances using post and get requests to a server.

## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Execute the `test.sh` script.
2. Check the terminal for distance verification results.
3. Observe the console for detailed logs, including courier movements within specific areas.

Once the application is running, you'll receive messages indicating successful courier location updates. Additionally, you'll see logs when a courier enters designated areas, such as Migros stores.
